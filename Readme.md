# Attendance Management Project

This is the initial setup for the Attendance Management System project.

## Structure
- `src/com/school/Main.java`: Contains the welcome messages Java program.

- ## Session 2: Core Domain Modelling
- Defined `Student` class with `studentId`, `name`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Defined `Course` class with `courseId`, `courseName`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Utilized arrays of objects in `Main.java` to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of `this` keyword.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/Student.java src/com/school/Course.java src/com/school/Main.java` (or `javac src/com/school/*.java`)
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`

## Part 3: Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation
- Added constructors in `Student` and `Course` classes.
- Implemented automatic unique ID generation using `private static` variables.
- Changed `Course`'s `courseId` to an `int` for easier auto-incrementation.
- Updated `Main.java` to create multiple objects and verified ID progression.

### How to Run
```bash
javac src/com/school/Student.java src/com/school/Course.java src/com/school/Main.java
java -cp src com.school.Main



## Part 5: Establishing Students, Teaching & Non-Teaching Staff hierarchy
- Created a base class `Person.java` with common attributes (`id`, `name`), a universal auto-ID generator, and a `displayDetails()` method.
- Modified `Student.java` to inherit from `Person`, using `super()` to call the parent constructor and overriding `displayDetails()` to add student-specific info (e.g., grade level).
- Created `Teacher.java` extending `Person`, adding a `subjectTaught` attribute and its own `displayDetails()`.
- Created `Staff.java` extending `Person`, adding a `role` attribute and its own `displayDetails()`.
- Demonstrated creation and display of `Student`, `Teacher`, and `Staff` objects in `Main.java`.
- Updated `AttendanceRecord` creation to use the inherited `getId()` method.



## Part 6: Interface-Driven Persistence with Storage
- Defined a `Storable` interface with a `toDataString()` method.
- Modified `Student`, `Course`, and `AttendanceRecord` classes to implement `Storable`.
- Created `FileStorageService` to save lists of `Storable` objects to text files.
- Demonstrated saving students, courses, and attendance records to `students.txt`, `courses.txt`, `attendance_log.txt`.

## Part 7: Polymorphic Behaviour in Attendance and Displaying Reports
- Modified `AttendanceRecord` to hold `Student` and `Course` objects instead of just their IDs, enhancing its object-oriented nature and how records are displayed. The `toDataString()` method still uses IDs for simpler file storage.
- Created a `displaySchoolDirectory(List<Person> people)` method in `Main.java` to demonstrate polymorphism. This method iterates through a list of `Person` objects (containing `Student`, `Teacher`, `Staff` instances) and calls `person.displayDetails()`. The correct overridden method for each specific object type is executed at runtime.
- Populated a `List<Person>` in `main` and used it with `displaySchoolDirectory`.
- Updated `Main.java` to use `instanceof` and casting when preparing the list of students for saving, as `Person` itself does not implement `Storable`.
- Discussed how polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code by treating different object types uniformly through a common interface or base class reference.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile: `javac src/com/school/*.java`
3. Run: `java -cp src com.school.Main`
